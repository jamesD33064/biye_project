# Voice Conversion
## Source
here is a pytorch implementation of the paper: StarGAN-VC: Non-parallel many-to-many voice conversion with star generative adversarial networks https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.02169 .

and source code is from https://github.com/liusongxiang/StarGAN-Voice-Conversion
## Usage
the step only need to do is run:
```
python main.py --src_wav {SrcWavPath} --trg_spk {TrgcWavPath}
```
under the folder /VoiceConversion/
